# Spring Boot Backend for Book Management REST API

This project is a backend application built using Spring Boot that provides REST APIs for managing books. It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on books stored in a MySQL database.

## Features

- **Get Books**: Retrieve all books or search for specific books based on criteria.
- **Post Books**: Add new books to the database.
- **Delete Books**: Remove existing books from the database.
- **Put (Update) Books**: Update existing books in the database.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Core programming language used for backend development.
- **Spring Boot**: Provides a framework for building production-ready Spring-based applications.
- **Spring Boot Web**: Offers features for building web applications with Spring Boot.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Simplifies data access layer implementation and provides support for the JPA (Java Persistence API).
- **Hibernate**: Implements JPA specifications and simplifies database operations.
- **MySQL Database**: Relational database management system for storing book data.

## Usage

1. Start the Spring Boot application.
2. Use a REST client (e.g., Postman) to interact with the provided REST APIs.
3. Perform CRUD operations on books using the following endpoints:
   - `GET /api/books`: Retrieve all books.
   - `GET /api/books/{id}`: Retrieve a specific book by its ID.
   - `POST /api/books`: Add a new book.
   - `PUT /api/books/{id}`: Update an existing book.
   - `DELETE /api/books/{id}`: Delete a book by its ID.
